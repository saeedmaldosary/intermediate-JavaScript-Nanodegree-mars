### Big Picture

Mars rover dashboard that consumes NASA API. The dashboard will allow the user to select which rover's information they want to view. Once they have selected a rover, they will be able to see the most recent images taken by that rover, as well as important information about the rover and its mission. 

### Getting Started

 - [ ] For this project we are using yarn as our package manager, so to install your dependencies run:

```yarn install``` 

**If you don’t have yarn installed globally, follow their installation documentation here according to your operating system: https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install

2. Next you'll need a NASA developer API key in order to access the API endpoints. To do that, go here: https://api.nasa.gov/. If you want to simply look around at what api endpoints NASA offers, you can use their provided DEMO_KEY to do this.

3. Run `yarn start` in your terminal and go to `http:localhost:3000` to check that your app is working. If you don't see an image on the page, check that your api key is set up correctly.

4. Remember to commit frequently, use branches, and leave good commit messages! You'll thank yourself later.

### Above and Beyond

The NASA API has a lot more data to offer than what we are using here. You are not limited to the API calls I require. Look here (https://api.nasa.gov/ at the Browse API's section) to see all that's available.
